/**
 * common/Router.js
 * 
 * What it Does:
 *   This file collects all of the koji.json files in your pages directory and builds them into routes to be
 *   served by your application. If your page is missing a koji.json this file is the reason it is not showing up.
 *   We use some fancy react features to lazy load in new pages with react's relatively new Suspense system.
 * 
 * Things to Change:
 *   If you have very specific views about how pages should be routed using react, then change them around here.
 *   Also if you want to use something like helmet to give each page a specific title you can add that in here
 *   as well. Basically anything having to do with switching between pages can be changed around in this file.
 *
